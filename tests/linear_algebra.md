# Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

## Linear independence

It is easy to prove that eigenspaces are disjoint.
We said ~v~ is an eigenvector of ~T~ if

~ Tx = kx ~ 

for some ~k~ in ~K~.

--

So if ~Tx = kx~ and ~Ty = k'y~, ~x~ and ~y~ are distinct,
and ~y != qx~, then ~k'~ and ~k~ cannot be equal, and the
two vectors cannot be elements of the same eigenspace.

--

Note if ~y + qx~ then ~T(y) = T(qx) = k(qx) = ky~, and the
two vectors do belong to the same eigenspace and have
the same eigenvalue. So 'scaled versions' of the same
vector belong to the same eigenspace.
