# BEAMER MARKDOWN

Write Beamer Slides With A Clean DSL

____________________________________

## What Is Beamer Markdown?

* Markdown is a plain text format that makes it
  easy to write human-readable rich text

* Markdown is a (WYASJHASJH) format, and not a (WSIWG)
  format

_____________________________________

* Markdown documents can be written easily on any
  editor, and are not visually messy, which has
  many advantages:
  
  * It's hard to miss spelling mistakes and text reads closer
    to the 'printed' / compiled version, which makes it
    easy to think of corrections

  * The number of lines in a markdown document bears  a direct
    relationship to the space taken by a certain part of a
    given text -- it's easier to know when something is too
    long when length can be determined visually or by comparing
    a couple of integers

  * The number of lines in a markdown document bear a direct
    relationship to the space taken by a certain part of a
    given text -- it's easier to get the right idea of size
    at a glance

____________________________________

Since everyone has so much to do, and their energy is better
spent doing something more useful than scratching their heads
before `pdflatex` error messages

Why Not Just Have A Nice Markdown For Beamer?

Now, latex has lots of features

Easily extensible

You can always do stuff wrong

## Kitchen Items

If you are standing in a kitchen, you may find one or several of these items:

* A big plastic box that humms and has a door

* A small plastic box with a round door or
a lid that can be opened from above, with a strange cylinder with holes

== Note ======

The plastic things are all connected to a power supply, do not fiddle with them haphazardly

=======

_____________________

* The first item is called A FRIDGE
* The second item is a WASHING MACHINE

Both items are types of appliances
