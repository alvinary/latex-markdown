# BEAMER MARKDOWN

Write Beamer Slides With A Clean DSL

____________________________________

## What Is Beamer Markdown?

* Markdown is a plain text format that makes it
  easy to write human-readable rich text

* Markdown is a (WYASJHASJH) format, and not a (WSIWG)
  format

_____________________________________

* Markdown documents can be written easily on any
  editor, and are not visually messy, which has
  many advantages:
  
  * It's hard to miss spelling mistakes and text reads closer
    to the 'printed' / compiled version, which makes it
    easy to think of corrections

  * The number of lines in a markdown document bears  a direct
    relationship to the space taken by a certain part of a
    given text -- it's easier to know when something is too
    long when length can be determined visually or by comparing
    a couple of integers

  * The number of lines in a markdown document bear a direct
    relationship to the space taken by a certain part of a
    given text -- it's easier to get the right idea of size
    at a glance

____________________________________

Since everyone has so much to do, and their energy is better
spent doing something more useful than scratching their heads
before `pdflatex` error messages

It is easy to prove that eigenspaces are disjoint.
We say $$$$ is an eigenvector of $$$$ if

	$$$$

for some $$$$ in $$$$.

So if $$$$ and $$$$, $$$$ and $$$$ are distinct,
and $$$$, then $$$$ and $$$$ cannot be equal, and
the two vectors cannot be elements of the same
eigenspace.

Note if $$$$ then $$$$, and in that case the two
vectors belong to the same eigenspace.

It is easy to prove that eigenspaces are disjoint.
We said ~v~ is an eigenvector of ~T~ if

~ Tx = kx ~ 

for some ~k~ in ~K~.

So if ~Tx = kx~ and ~Ty = k'y~, ~x~ and ~y~ are distinct,
and ~y != qx~, then ~k'~ and ~k~ cannot be equal, and the
two vectors cannot be elements of the same eigenspace.

Note if ~y + qx~ then ~T(y) = T(qx) = k(qx) = ky~, and the
two vectors do belong to the same eigenspace and have
the same eigenvalue. So 'scaled versions' of the same
vector belong to the same eigenspace.

This is the conceptual diagram with the generalization
of Bayes theorem from last class: ~pi(theta/X) alpha l(theta) dot pi(theta)~

The absolute value of both sides gives 

~ (| epsilon sub [: n + 1 :] |) = fraction ( (| f'' (xi sub n) |) ) over ( 2 (| f' ( x sub n ) |) ) dot epsilon sub n sup 2 ~

and this shows something.

## The typed abstract machine

* A JVM state consists of a heap and a stack frame. Each
  frame contains a program counter, an operand stack and
  a register map.
* A typed state contains a stack type ~st~ and a register
  type ~rt~
* The typed abstract machine is defined by rules of the form

	from
		P[i] = instr
		constraints
	infer
		i |- st, rt => st', rt'

_________________________________________________

## Sample rules

     from 
_______________________________________
i |- int :: int st, rt => int :: st, rt

        # Why sections are better suited for a single numeral

        There are many sections, and a single title. So titles can have a less
        typable syntax without interferring too much.

        ## How about subsections?

        Subsections are written with double hashes/ double numerals.

        ## Some other subsection

        This is some other subsection.
