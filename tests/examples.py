# BEAMER MARKDOWN

Write Beamer Slides With A Clean DSL

____________________________________

## What Is Beamer Markdown?

* Markdown is a plain text format that makes it
  easy to write human-readable rich text

* Markdown is a (WYASJHASJH) format, and not a (WSIWG)
  format

_____________________________________

* Markdown documents can be written easily on any
  editor, and are not visually messy, which has
  many advantages:
  
  * It's hard to miss spelling mistakes and text reads closer
    to the 'printed' / compiled version, which makes it
    easy to think of corrections

  * The number of lines in a markdown document bears  a direct
    relationship to the space taken by a certain part of a
    given text -- it's easier to know when something is too
    long when length can be determined visually or by comparing
    a couple of integers

  * The number of lines in a markdown document bear a direct
    relationship to the space taken by a certain part of a
    given text -- it's easier to get the right idea of size
    at a glance

____________________________________

Since everyone has so much to do, and their energy is better
spent doing something more useful than scratching their heads
before `pdflatex` error messages

        # Why sections are better suited for a single numeral

        There are many sections, and a single title. So titles can have a less
        typable syntax without interferring too much.

        ## How about subsections?

        Subsections are written with double hashes/ double numerals.

        ## Some other subsection

        This is some other subsection.
