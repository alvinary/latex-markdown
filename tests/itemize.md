## Sample itemize markdown text

There are several items:

* The first

* The second

* The third

All these items are supposed to be preceded by a single break (as a listing), 
and each item is followed by a single break (and that is enough to put some
space between the listing and the text that follows).

This should break if the document ends with a listing without a break, which is
not ideal

* Let's check that out
* So this last one has a break after it
