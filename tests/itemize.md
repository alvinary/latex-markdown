## Sample itemize markdown text

There are *. several .* items :footnote [. None of these items are nested. .]:

* The first

* The second

* The third

All these items are ._ supposed _. to be preceded by a single break (as a listing), 
and each item is followed by a ._ single _. break (and that is enough to put some
space between the listing and the text that follows).

This ._ should _. break if the document ends with a listing without a break, which is
not ideal :footnote [. 55 -- Note this footnote does not respect automatic numbering. .]

* *. Let's check that out .*

* So this last one has a break after it
